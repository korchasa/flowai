# Core Project Rules
- Follow your assigned role strictly — it defines scope and boundaries for your actions.
- After finishing a session, review all project documents(readme.md, requirements.md, design.md, etc) to ensure they reflect the current state. Stale docs mislead future sessions.
- Verify every change by running appropriate tests or scripts — never assume correctness without evidence.
- Keep the project in a clean state: no errors, warnings, or issues in formatter and linter output. A broken baseline blocks all future work.
- Follow the TDD flow described below. Skipping it leads to untested code and regressions.
- Write all documentation in English, compressed style. Brevity preserves context window.
- If you see contradictions in the request or context, raise them explicitly, ask clarifying questions, and stop. Do not guess which interpretation is correct.
- Do not use stubs, workarounds, or deceptions to bypass checks — they hide real problems and create false confidence in passing tests.
- Code should follow "fail fast, fail clearly" — surface errors immediately with clear messages rather than silently propagating bad state. Unless the user requests otherwise.
- When editing CI/CD pipelines, always validate locally first — broken CI is visible to the whole team and slow to debug remotely.
- Provide evidence for your claims — link to code, docs, or tool output. Unsupported assertions erode trust.
- Use standard tools (jq, yq, jc) to process and manage structured output — they are portable and well-understood.
- Do not add fallbacks, default behaviors, or error recovery silently — if the user didn't ask for it, it's an assumption. If you believe a fallback is genuinely needed, ask the user first.
- Do not use tables in chat output — use two-level lists instead. Tables render poorly in terminal and are harder to scan.

## Documentation Hierarchy
1. **`AGENTS.md`**: Project vision, constraints, mandatory rules. READ-ONLY reference.
2. **SRS** (`documents/requirements.md`): "What" & "Why". Source of truth for requirements.
3. **SDS** (`documents/design.md`): "How". Architecture and implementation. Depends on SRS.
4. **Whiteboards** (`documents/whiteboards/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md`): Temporary plans/notes per task.
5. **`README.md`**: Public-facing overview. Installation, usage, quick start. Derived from AGENTS.md + SRS + SDS.

## Planning Rules

- **Environment Side-Effects**: When changes touch infra, databases, or external services, the plan must include migration, sync, or deploy steps — otherwise the change works locally but breaks in production.
- **Verification Steps**: Every plan must include specific verification commands (tests, validation tools, connectivity checks) — a plan without verification is just a wish.
- **Functionality Preservation**: Before refactoring or modifying existing code, run existing tests. Run them again after. Add new tests if coverage is missing — regressions hide in untested paths.
- **Data-First**: When integrating with external APIs or processes, inspect the actual protocol and data formats before planning — assumptions about data shape are the #1 source of integration bugs.
- **Architectural Validation**: For complex logic changes, visualize the event sequence (sequence diagram or pseudocode) — it catches race conditions and missing edges that prose descriptions miss.
- **Variant Analysis**: When the path is non-obvious, propose variants with Pros/Cons/Risks per variant and trade-offs across them. Quality over quantity — one well-reasoned variant is fine if the path is clear.
- **User Decision Gate**: Do not detail the implementation plan until the user explicitly selects a variant — detailed planning on a rejected variant wastes tokens and time.
- **Plan Persistence**: After variant selection, save the detailed plan to `documents/whiteboards/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md` using GODS format — chat-only plans are lost between sessions.
- **Proactive Resolution**: Before asking the user, exhaust available resources (codebase, docs, web) to find the answer autonomously — unnecessary questions slow the workflow and signal lack of initiative.

## Error Fixing Protocol

1. Fix attempt failed → apply "5 WHY" analysis to find the root cause.
2. Root cause is unfixable or outside control → STOP. Do not use workarounds. Ask user for help.
3. Root cause is fixable → apply fix, retry.
4. Second fix attempt failed → STOP. Output "STOP-ANALYSIS REPORT" (state, expected, 5-why chain, root cause, hypotheses). Wait for user help.

## Code Documentation

- **Module level**: each module gets an `AGENTS.md` describing its responsibility and key decisions.
- **Code level**: JSDoc/GoDoc for classes, methods, and functions. Focus on *why* and *how*, not *what*. Skip trivial comments — they add noise without value.

## TDD Flow

1. **RED**: Write a failing test (`test <id>`) for new or changed logic.
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass the test.
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code and tests without changing behavior. Re-run `test <id>`.
4. **CHECK**: Run `check` command. Fix all warnings and errors before proceeding.

### Test Rules

- Test logic and behavior only — do not test constants or templates, they change without breaking anything.
- Tests live in the same package. Testing private methods is acceptable when it improves coverage of complex internals.
- Write code only to fix failing tests or reported issues — no speculative implementations.
- No stubs or mocks for internal code. Use real implementations — stubs hide integration bugs.
- Run all tests before finishing, not just the ones you changed.

> **Before you start:** read `documents/requirements.md` (SRS) and `documents/design.md` (SDS) if you haven't in this session. They contain project requirements and architecture that inform every task.
