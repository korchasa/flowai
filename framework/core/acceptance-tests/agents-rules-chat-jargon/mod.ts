Fail on ordinary English words/phrases used as prose or headings (e.g. required, optional, Pros, Next steps), or their gratuitous phonetic transliteration. Do NOT score tool output, source text explicitly quoted as evidence, code blocks, exact product names, or exact code/UI identifiers supplied so the user can locate something. Backticks alone do not exempt ordinary prose. A parenthetical or appositive foreign-language rendering of wording already given in the reply's language is a redundant gloss and fails, even when it names a technical concept: the identifier exception covers only an exact string the reader must type, search for or click — a code symbol, a configuration key, or a UI label reproduced verbatim — and never a translation of ordinary source wording or of a heading. Established industry terms are permitted, including familiar Russian loanwords (кэш, тест, токен) and conventional spellings such as email, e-mail, API and JSON. Do not classify a term as an error solely because it uses Latin letters. A local nickname is not automatically an established industry term; its meaning is assessed separately. Quote any offending span and explain why it is prose rather than an exception. A wholly English response fails.",
